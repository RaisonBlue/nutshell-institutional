In today’s privacy-aware world, an individual’s consent has become an integral part of any organization dealing with customer data. It refers to the authorization of the individual to allow the processing of his or her personal data. Most companies leverage consent as a lawful basis of data processing for marketing purposes including direct marketing and marketing [via cookies](/#).

With the growing concern of data privacy, most global privacy laws have tended to emphasize the need for freely given consent from customers for the use of their personal data for marketing purposes. Consider the European Union’s data protection framework that requires organizations to obtain users’ consent prior to the use of cookies or similar tracking technologies. Such consent needs to be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the user’s wishes.

To fulfill this legal obligation, organizations must display cookie consent banners to obtain users’ consent. This article sheds light on what a cookie consent banner is, the types of a cookie consent banner, and how organizations can deploy a cookie consent banner on their websites as per the applicable law.

## What is a Cookie Consent Banner?

A cookie consent banner is a cookie notification that is displayed on websites and other apps in the form of a banner or pop-up upon the user’s visit that explicitly asks for users' consent before deploying cookies. It does not just inform the user about cookies on a website but asks for their consent first. The cookie consent banner must be sufficiently noticeable and in an easily accessible form. The text of the banner must be in clear, plain and unambiguous language for the average user to understand.

## Examples and Layouts of Cookie Consent Banner

Here is an example of what a cookie consent banner looks like:

There are several types of cookie consent banners that can be integrated into your website and here are some examples of different types of cookie banners:

- Top Header: This type adds a notification to the header of the site ensuring that the user is aware of its significance and interacts with it.
- Inline Header: This style places a fixed notification within the header of every page of your site. This lets users know that you use cookies and that consent is assumed by continuing to use the site. This type of consent may not be acceptable under certain privacy regulations.
- Footer: This is similar to the inline header with the difference of the notification being on the bottom of the page rather than the top. This is again opt-out consent and may be unacceptable under most regulations.
- Modal: This cookie banner is a fixed pop-up box that remains on top of the page until the user interacts with it.

## Cookie Consent Banner Layout

A cookie banner should be customized to fit your brand. Here are some examples of different banner layouts that you can incorporate into your website.

## Types of Cookie Consent Banners

There are two main types of cookie consent banners that can be integrated into an organization's website.

### 1. Implicit Cookie Consent Banner

An implicit cookie consent banner does not automatically obtain the user’s consent, rather it assumes that the user has consented to the use of cookies by merely visiting the website. An example of this would be a banner that states “continuing to use this website will be taken as consent to use cookies”. Such cookie consent banners are compliant with data privacy laws that do not require organizations to obtain user’s consent for the use of cookies such as the United State’s California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

An implicit cookie consent banner must include the following:

- Information about the various types of cookies that the organization intends to drop including strictly necessary cookies, along with their purposes.
- Notice of the right to opt-out of the sale of personal data via cookies.
- A link to the organization’s privacy policy.

### 2. Explicit Cookie Consent Banner

An explicit cookie consent banner obtains explicit consent from the user prior to the activation of cookies. Such cookie consent banners are compliant with data privacy laws that require organizations to obtain prior consent of the user for the use of cookies such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and e-Privacy Directive.

An explicit cookie consent banner must include the following:

- Information about the various types of cookies that an organization intends to drop including the strictly necessary cookies, along with their purposes.
- Equally prominent accept and reject buttons, thereby allowing users to withdraw the use of cookies as easily as they can accept it.
- Selection and deselection of individual cookie categories based on their purposes.
